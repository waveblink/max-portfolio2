        <h1>Cooking</h1>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p id="p1">Cooking is another one of my favorite hobbies, I actually almost became a chef instead of
            going into Software Engineering like I am now. I even went to culinary school for almost 2 years before I
            decided to come back and finish university. I have been cooking ever since I was a little kid, mostly
            out of necessity since my parents either never cooked much, or when they did cook it wasn't the best. It was
            a grade A for effort but the taste left some to be desired. While I was in culinary school my favorite subject
            was definitely baking, something about the precision of baking and the amount of effort and time to pay off
            into something great always made me happy. I ended up working as a prep cook for a couple years, and I found
            out quickly that I did not want to be a chef. While sometimes the work can be fulfilling, it just doesn't feel
            worth it for the time and effort in terms of the money you make. </p>
