            <p id="p1">Hi, my name is Maxwell Hahn and I am currently a senior at the University of North Texas. Currently
            my degree is Business Computer Information Systems, and I am looking to graduate and become a Software Engineer.
            Originally, I wanted to become a purely back-end software engineer, but after learning HTML and CSS, I wouldn't
            mind doing front-end as much. There are definitely still a lot of frustrations that come with working in front-end,
            but I would do any Software Engineer job to get my foot through the door. Anyways, this is a blog of sorts where I
            talk about things that I enjoy and just some general stuff about me. Currently, this website isn't completed,
            at least to where I want it to be. I want this to end up being one of my main projects that I show to potential employers,
            so by the end of the semester I want this to be as polished and professional looking as possible.</p>
