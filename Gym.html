        <p id="p1">The gym is a massive part of my life. It all started for me when I was in my senior year in middle school,
        this is where I got the first taste of the gym due to being in football. Over the years I fell in love with the
        feeling of putting my body through the struggle and being able to see and feel the visual improvements of my hard work
        paying off. The gym has also helped branch of into other ways to improve my life, like through improving my diet and losing weight.
        In the course of around a year or 2 I was able to drop 130lbs, and now on the side of my current job I do personal training and am
        pursuing possibly competing in a bodybuilding competition sometime in the future. </p>
