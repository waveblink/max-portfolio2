            <p id="p1">Traveling has always been a large part of my life, this was mostly due to the fact that my mom is
            a flight attendant, so we got to travel all over when I was younger for free basically. I never really
            appreciated it when I was younger, but now traveling is one of my favorite things to do. I have a lot of plans
            for whenever I graduate to go travel places I have always wanted to go to or go back to. Currently my top
            places that I want to go are Paris France, everywhere in Japan, and Seoul South Korea. With my current job
            its a bit hard to travel anywhere for long periods of time, but I have been traveling a lot to Chicago which
            is where im hoping to move once I get my new job post graduation. Once that happens ill start to plan a lot
            more trips (hopefully).</p>
